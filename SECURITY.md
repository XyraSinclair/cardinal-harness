# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not file a public issue for suspected security vulnerabilities.

If the project is hosted on GitHub, prefer opening a GitHub Security Advisory.
If that is not available, open an issue with minimal details and ask for a
private follow-up channel.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on the latest release series.
