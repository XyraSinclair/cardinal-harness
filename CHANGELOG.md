## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- `cardinal sort`: sort newline-delimited items (or a JSON array) from a file
  or stdin by a natural-language criterion, with `--scores`, `--reverse`,
  `--format text|json|jsonl|csv`, `--top-k`, `--budget`, `--trace`,
  `--cache-only` (keyless offline replay), and a one-line cost/stop receipt
  on stderr. Refuses to print output when every comparison failed.
- Library conveniences `sort_texts` / `sort_documents` (`rerank::sort`) over
  the single-attribute rerank path, including a middle-boundary default for
  whole-list sorts (a `top_k = n` degenerate case would stop before the first
  comparison).
- Tag-triggered release workflow building `cardinal` binaries for six targets
  with sha256 checksums.
- Tight crates.io packaging (explicit `include`, ~50 files), docs.rs metadata,
  and `CITATION.cff`.
- Live `cardinal sort` demo receipt pack under
  `artifacts/live/sort-demo-2026-07-02/`.
- Fixed CI checks under current stable toolchain (rustfmt/clippy/rustdoc).
- Updated transitive dependency `bytes` to address RUSTSEC-2026-0007.
- Added a Likert baseline synthetic eval runner (`cardinal eval-likert`) for comparisons.

### Removed
- Retired prompt template `canonical_v2_attr_first`. Empirically tested in a
  comprehensive prompt layout sweep (4 variants × 7 models × 8 attributes) and
  found to offer no advantage over `canonical_v2`. The slug still resolves to
  `canonical_v2` for backward compatibility but is no longer a distinct template.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-31

- Initial public release.
