Sort lists with LLMs — and get numbers you can defend.

```console
$ cardinal sort ideas.txt --by "expected impact on retention"
```

`cardinal-harness` turns noisy LLM pairwise **ratio** judgements ("how many
times more of X does A have than B?") into globally consistent **cardinal
scores with uncertainty**, spends each next comparison where it buys the most
information about the order, and stops when the top-k is certain enough — or
the budget runs out. Every run returns receipts: comparisons, tokens, dollar
cost, stop reason, and an optional per-judgement trace.

## Why not just ask the model to sort?

Every obvious way to sort a list with an LLM breaks somewhere:

| Approach | What breaks |
|---|---|
| "Rate each item 1–10" | Miscalibrated, anchor-dependent; scores cluster at 7–8; no error bars |
| "Sort this list" in one prompt | Position bias, context limits, silently dropped or hallucinated items |
| "Which is better, A or B?" over pairs | Ordinal only — throws away *how much* better; naive schedules cost O(n²) |
| Elo / Bradley–Terry over wins | Better aggregation, but still magnitude-blind and usually passive about which pair to ask next |

`cardinal-harness` treats each ratio answer as a noisy log-space measurement,
fits latent scores over the whole comparison graph with a robust solver (IRLS,
Huber loss), reads uncertainty off the posterior, and plans the next
comparison by effective resistance on the graph. Default budget is 4·n
comparisons — O(n), not O(n²).

What you get that the alternatives don't, in one package:

- **Cardinal magnitudes**, not just an order — "A is ~3× better" survives into the output.
- **Uncertainty per item** and a top-k error estimate, honestly reported.
- **Active pair selection** and principled stopping under an explicit budget.
- **Counterbalancing by default**: every planned pair is asked in both presentation orders, and the disagreement rate is reported — position bias measured, not assumed away.
- **Attribute health probes**: judge the opposite side of your criterion (`--two-sided`) and alternate phrasings (`--also-by`), get rank-consistency receipts that tell you whether the attribute even coheres for this judge.
- **Receipts**: JSONL trace per judgement, token/cost accounting, SQLite cache, seeded reproducibility.

## Quickstart

```bash
cargo install cardinal-harness
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here   # any model on OpenRouter

cardinal sort examples/sort-demo.txt --by "usefulness as advice for a software engineer" --scores
```

Real output (preserved, with full receipts, under
[`artifacts/live/sort-demo-2026-07-02/`](artifacts/live/sort-demo-2026-07-02/)):

```text
1.082±0.741	premature optimization is the root of all evil
0.609±0.785	measure twice, cut once
0.514±0.772	a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
0.451±0.768	don't put all your eggs in one basket
0.327±0.758	practice makes perfect
0.258±0.785	if it ain't broke, don't fix it
0.180±0.783	too many cooks spoil the broth
0.000±0.737	a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

sorted 8 items by "usefulness as advice for a software engineer" · 32 comparisons (1 cached, 0 refused) · $0.0500 · stop: budget_exhausted
```

Note what the receipt admits: at the default 4·n budget those posterior stds
overlap. You get a well-motivated point estimate of the order, not a certified
one — raise `--budget` or focus `--top-k` when you need certainty. The same
run replays offline, keyless, for $0 via `--cache-only`.

`sort` reads newline-delimited items or a JSON array (of strings or
`{"id","text"}` objects) from a file or stdin, and writes plain lines (pipeable),
`--format json|jsonl|csv`, `--scores`, `--reverse`, `--trace trace.jsonl`.
A sort where every comparison fails refuses to print, loudly.

## The evidence path: logprobs as judgements

With `--template ratio_letter_v1`, each comparison asks for ONE letter from
a 52-token alphabet (case = which item, letter = magnitude on the ladder,
`A` = parity, `!` = refuse) — so a single completion position's top-k
logprobs are the model's **full judgement PMF**. The solver then weights
each observation by its **measured variance** instead of a stated
confidence. Rendering, parsing, and mass accounting are delegated to
[seriate](https://github.com/XyraSinclair/seriate); where a provider hides
or rejects logprobs, the path degrades loudly to sampled mode and the run
summary says so (`evidence: 63/63 logprob-mode, visible 0.99`).

Live head-to-head at equal budget and cost on gpt-5.4-mini
([receipts](artifacts/live/evidence-path-2026-07-04/)): top-to-bottom
separation **≈4.0σ vs ≈1.4σ** for the canonical JSON path — roughly 3× the
resolving power per dollar, because each call consumes the model's prior
instead of one sample from it. Caveats in the receipt pack, including that
the two instruments induce correlated but not identical orderings
(Spearman 0.74) — different elicitations tap different priors.

## Healthy elicitation, by default

Most LLM-annotation pathologies are invisible unless you deliberately measure
them. `sort` measures them as part of the run:

- **Both orders, every pair.** LLM judges favor whichever item is presented
  first. Randomizing order (still available via `--no-counterbalance`) only
  averages that bias; the default asks each planned pair in both orders,
  cancels the bias per-pair, and reports the disagreement rate.
- **The opposite side of the attribute.** `--two-sided` also judges
  `lack of <criterion>` (weight −1) and reports whether the two sides mirror
  each other. If they don't, your attribute doesn't mean anything stable to
  this judge — better to learn that before trusting the annotation.
- **Alternate phrasings.** `--also-by "<paraphrase>"` judges the criterion
  under other wordings and reports cross-phrasing rank consistency.

A real run (preserved under
[`artifacts/live/healthy-sort-demo-2026-07-02/`](artifacts/live/healthy-sort-demo-2026-07-02/)):

```console
$ cardinal sort examples/sort-demo.txt \
    --by "usefulness as advice for a software engineer" \
    --two-sided --also-by "how much practical value it offers someone building software" \
    --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 --budget 120

sorted 8 items · 120 comparisons · $0.3441 · order flips: 11/51 · stop: budget_exhausted
probe [opposite]   "lack of usefulness as advice...": consistency +0.81 — consistent
probe [paraphrase] "how much practical value...":    consistency +0.35 — shaky
```

That run caught the judge reversing itself on **21.6% of pairs** under order
swap, confirmed the criterion is two-sided coherent, and flagged that a
reasonable-sounding paraphrase materially changes the ranking. None of this is
visible in a single-prompt sort or a 1–10 rating pass.

## Building taste: elaborate, judge, explain

Good sorts start with good attribute prompts. Three commands help you get
there, from most magic to most manual:

- **`cardinal elaborate --by "impact"`** — one LLM call expands a terse
  criterion into a precise judging rubric (definition, what counts as more,
  what must not be rewarded), printed to stdout so it composes:
  `cardinal sort list.txt --by "$(cardinal elaborate --by impact)"` — or use
  `cardinal sort --elaborate` to do it inline. The rubric is always shown:
  the magic stays inspectable and editable.
- **`cardinal judge "<A>" "<B>" --by "<criterion>" --show-prompt`** — the
  lowest-level primitive: one pairwise judgement, with the fully rendered
  prompt on stderr and the parsed answer (direction, ratio, confidence,
  cost) on stdout. This is how you develop taste for what a criterion
  actually asks of the judge.
- **`cardinal explain ranking.txt --candidate "clarity" --propose 3`** — the
  inverse problem: you already HAVE a ranking you believe in. Explain
  measures candidate attributes (yours, plus LLM-proposed ones) with the
  normal pairwise machinery and reports which of them — alone and in fitted
  non-negative combination — reconstruct your order.

A real explain receipt (preserved under
[`artifacts/live/taste-tools-demo-2026-07-02/`](artifacts/live/taste-tools-demo-2026-07-02/)),
run against a ranking whose true generating attribute was known:

```text
attribute                                    | alone ρ | weight
---------------------------------------------|---------|-------
usefulness as advice for a software engineer |   +0.98 | 0.85
relevance to software engineering principles |   +0.79 | 0.01
encourages proactive careful planning        |   +0.21 | 0.00
wisdom applicable to technical decision-maki |   +0.81 | 0.15

weighted combination reconstructs your ranking at ρ = +0.98
```

The true attribute is recovered — top standalone correlation and dominant
fitted weight — while three plausible decoys are down-weighted. (One run, one
list; a demonstration of the mechanism, not a benchmark.)

When only the top of a list matters, `--top-k K` focuses the planner on the
K-boundary and `--prune-below <p>` additionally stops spending exploration
comparisons on items whose posterior chance of reaching the top-K drops below
`p` — the pruned count lands in the receipts as `entities_pruned`.

## Library

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;
use cardinal_harness::gateway::NoopUsageSink;
use cardinal_harness::rerank::{sort_texts, RerankExecution, SortOptions};
use cardinal_harness::{Attribution, ProviderGateway};

# async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let gateway = ProviderGateway::from_env(Arc::new(NoopUsageSink))?;
let execution = RerankExecution::new(Arc::new(gateway), Attribution::new("app::sort"));

let sorted = sort_texts(
    vec![
        "First essay...".into(),
        "Second essay...".into(),
        "Third essay...".into(),
    ],
    "clarity of explanation",
    execution,
    SortOptions::default(),
)
.await?;

for item in &sorted.items {
    println!("{:>2}. {:.3} ± {:.3}  {}", item.rank, item.latent_mean, item.latent_std, item.text);
}
println!("cost: ${:.4}", sorted.meta.provider_cost_nanodollars as f64 / 1e9);
# Ok(())
# }
```

`sort_documents` is the same with caller-owned ids. For multiple weighted
attributes, hard gates ("must be above the 25th percentile on safety"),
top-k-focused stopping, model ladder policies, and caching, use the full
`multi_rerank` API — see [docs/WORKED_EXAMPLE.md](docs/WORKED_EXAMPLE.md).

## Scope

This repo is intentionally narrow. It contains:

- canonical pairwise ratio prompts (the ratio ladder and JSON judgement contract)
- robust score fitting over pairwise observations
- multi-attribute reranking, gating, and top-k stopping
- OpenRouter gateway, pricing, usage, and SQLite cache support
- synthetic evaluation and reporting

Research workflows, training/export code, agent orchestration, and other
experimental layers belong in `openpriors-research`, not here.

Use it for list work where "how much better?" carries information: prompts,
research ideas, candidate plans, reviewer notes, backlog items — any shortlist
where the top cluster matters more than a cheap total order. Do not use it for
deterministic rankings, scalar metrics, or attributes too incoherent to
compare.

## Evidence status

The trade is explicit: this costs more than one-shot scoring, saves
comparisons versus exhaustive pairwise judging, and returns uncertainty plus
receipts instead of only a sorted list. The public evidence is deliberately
reproducible and deliberately narrow — it does **not** show a universal win:

- Offline synthetic evaluation and Likert/scalar comparison receipts live under `artifacts/eval/`.
- Preserved real OpenRouter cardinal-policy receipts live under `artifacts/live/openrouter-benchmark-2026-06-30/`: three policy runs, 459 fresh provider comparisons, 0 cache hits, 0 refusals, $0.994335 provider-reported cost.
- A live structured-judgment method comparison lives under `artifacts/live/method-comparison-2026-06-30-suite-v1/`: scalar matrix vs whole-list sort vs ordinal pairwise vs cardinal pairwise-ratio, judged against a separate LLM reference across six frozen task families.
- A live `sort` demo receipt lives under `artifacts/live/sort-demo-2026-07-02/`.
- `tests/live_method_receipts.rs` guards the live method pack: schema version, frozen suite hash, per-call receipts, usage totals, and absence of provider keys or local paths.
- The compact five-metric offline summary is mixed: 10 cardinal wins, 12 Likert wins, 18 ties. The raw-receipt delta reports 10/12/20 across 42 comparable rows.
- The live method comparison is also mixed: cardinal ties the best regime on two task families, stays close on two, and lags sharply on two.
- All current cardinal synthetic runs stop at `budget_exhausted`; the receipts do not prove early stopping or lower cost.
- Equal call counts are not equal token cost: pairwise prompts carry two items, scalar prompts one.
- An adversarial test battery (266 tests, [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)) pins the solver's mathematical claims — planted-truth recovery, Huber influence bounds, calibration coverage, pathological-judge behavior, method head-to-heads — and its honest negatives: ordinal beats ratio under heavy noise, and the budget-efficiency claim remains unproven.

The next empirical proof target is a larger frozen benchmark with repeated
runs, equalized token or dollar budgets, more held-out task families, and
human or high-budget external reference judgements. Details in
[docs/EVALUATION.md](docs/EVALUATION.md).

## Core idea

Instead of asking an LLM for unstable absolute scores, ask:

> How many times more of attribute X does A have than B?

Each answer becomes a noisy log-ratio observation on a fixed ladder
(1.0 … 26.0, geometric). Log-ratios compose additively, so the full comparison
graph over-determines the latent scores; a robust solver (IRLS + Huber)
downweights outlier judgements, the posterior gives per-item uncertainty, and
the planner targets the pair whose observation most reduces uncertainty about
the top-k boundary. Full rationale in [docs/ALGORITHM.md](docs/ALGORITHM.md)
and the compact mathematical contract in [docs/MODEL.md](docs/MODEL.md).

## Prompt surfaces

Two prompt templates are supported:

| Slug | Output shape | Use when |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `canonical_v2` | `{"higher_ranked":"A|B","ratio":1.0..26.0,"confidence":0.0..1.0}` | Default pairwise-ratio judgement. Use this unless you specifically need bucket-token logprobs. |
| `canonical_bucket_v1` | `{"higher_ranked":"A|B","ratio_bucket":0..16,"confidence":0.0..1.0}` | Bucket-index variant for runs that need to map output logprobs onto the fixed ratio ladder. |
| `ordinal_v1` | `{"higher_ranked":"A|B","confidence":0.0..1.0}` | Natural direction-only judgement; enters the solver as a fixed modest log-ratio. Strictly less informative than ratios — use as a baseline/control or when magnitude questions confuse the judge. |

Both templates use the same ratio ladder and the same refusal shape:
`{"refused":true}`. Unknown `prompt_template_slug` values are rejected.
Details in [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md).

## CLI

Beyond `sort`, the CLI exposes the full request surface:

```bash
# Validate a multi-rerank request locally: no API key, cache, or network.
cargo run --bin cardinal -- validate --request examples/multi-rerank-request.json

# Full multi-attribute rerank from JSON, with trace and markdown report.
cargo run --bin cardinal -- rerank \
  --request examples/multi-rerank-request.json \
  --out output.json --trace trace.jsonl --report report.md

# Model policies: built-in names or JSON files.
cargo run --bin cardinal -- rerank \
  --request examples/multi-rerank-request.json \
  --policy frontier_ladder --out output.json
#   examples/model-policy-quality-only.json    -> anthropic/claude-opus-4.6

# Generate a report later from a saved request + response.
cargo run --bin cardinal -- report \
  --request examples/multi-rerank-request.json \
  --response output.json --out report.md

# Offline synthetic evaluation receipts (no API key).
cargo run --bin cardinal -- eval --out artifacts/eval/synthetic_eval.jsonl --curve-csv artifacts/eval/synthetic_curves.csv
cargo run --bin cardinal -- eval-likert --out artifacts/eval/likert_eval.jsonl --curve-csv artifacts/eval/likert_curves.csv
cargo run --bin cardinal -- eval-compare --mode ratio --out artifacts/eval/comparison_summary.json

# Cache management.
cargo run --bin cardinal -- cache-export --out cache.jsonl
cargo run --bin cardinal -- cache-prune --max-age-days 30
```

Live benchmark scripts (`examples/live_openrouter_benchmark.py`,
`examples/live_method_comparison.py`) reproduce the checked-in receipt packs;
both require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and spend provider credits.
